\section{Personal Research}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
When the computer is powered on, the CPU executed a program contained in ROM (like BIOS) at a predefined address. The program (BIOS as example) searches for devices installed on the computer and loads them and tries a power-on self-test. If no error occurs, it locate boot loader software held on a storage device. It loads and executes the first boot software (often an OS) it finds, giving it control of the PC. The role of BIOS is a bridge between the PC and the operating system.
\item
Hybrid kernels combine micro kernels and monolithic kernels. \\
Exo kernels are small and give more direct access to the hardware.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Course application}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item Disable all interrupts should only be allowed in kernel mode because the process of interrupt is in kernel mode.
\item Read the time-of-day clock should only be allowed in kernel mode because it needs I/O with the hardware (CMOS).
\item Set the time-of-day clock should only be allowed in kernel mode because it needs I/O with the hardware (CMOS).
\item Change the memory map should only be allowed in kernel mode because memory management is in kernel mode.
\end{enumerate}
\item Since there are four logic cores in the system, three programs can be executed in parallel, 20 ms is needed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Simple problem}
The RAM needed to support a 25 lines by 80 rows character monochrome text screen is $25\times80/8=250\unit{B}$. It costs  $250\times5/1024=\$ 1.22$.

The RAM needed to support a 1024 x 768 pixel 24-bit color bitmap is $1024\times768\times24/8=2304\unit{KB}$. It costs $2304\times5=\$ 11570$.

Now the cost if RAM is about $\$10/\unit{GB}$.
