\begin{itemize}
\item Where is the CPU hidden?

The CPU is hidden under the CPU fan, because the working of CPU in high frequency will release so much heat and destroy the CPU itself if no cooling device is installed. 

\item What are the North and South bridges?

The north bridge is mainly responsible for connecting the CPU and the RAM controller.

The south bridge is mainly responsible for the communication in the I/O bus, such as USB, PCI/PCI-e, SATA, and LAN.

\item How are the North and South bridges connected together?

They are connected with DMI (Direct Media Interface).

\item What is the BIOS?

BIOS is the Basic Input Output System, which is stored in a ROM on the motherboard. It can read/write variables in CMOS to manage the motherboard, e.g., booting the operating systems according to the saved information. It can also have a hardware check before booting to ensure all of the hardwares are working.

\item Take out the CPU, rotate it and try to plug it back in a different position, is that working?

No, the CPU should be plugged in a unique direction. Most of the modern CPUs have different shapes of corners so that the user can only plug in it in the right direction.

\item Explain what overclocking is?
